# Snake Game

This is a simple **Snake Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. In this game, the player controls a snake, which grows longer as it eats food. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Controlled by arrow keys.
- **Food Generation**: Food is randomly generated on the grid.
- **Score Tracking**: Each time the snake eats food, the score increases by 10 points.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.
- **Game Reset**: After the game ends, the snake resets to its initial position and the score resets to 0.

## How to Play

1. Use the **Arrow Keys** (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to control the snake.
2. The snake will grow longer each time it eats the red food.
3. The game will end when the snake hits the wall or runs into its own body.
4. The score will be displayed at the top of the screen.

## Files

1. **index.html**: The main HTML structure of the game.
2. **style.css**: Contains the CSS for styling the game board, snake, food, and score.

## Future Improvements

- **Speed Increase**: Increase the snake's speed as it grows longer.
- **Level System**: Add multiple levels with varying difficulty.
